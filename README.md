D3.geo Cookbook
===============

This is an outline for specific steps when using D3 to create maps. Each .html file is added as a specific step or tool you may find yourself using when making an svg-based web map. Beyond the first boilerplate file, each file will use similar data and processes. 

*Reminder:* All of these examples use CDN scripts hosted remotely instead of their own self-hosted versions (i.e. d3.js). If you are building an application with D3, it is wise to use your own source instead of relying on another server.
